# WebPocket
I was tired of the old fashion bookmark so I created my own using iFrames. I am a very visual person and never remembered what
bookmarks went to what article I was reading or video I like. By using iFrames I was able to load the webpage in webpocket and 
quickly flip though all my bookmarks to find the right one and once I do you I simply click a button and it opens the website 
in a new page. Unfortunately before I started I was unaware that many websites blocked iFrames from load their sites
